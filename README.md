This console application reads a list of names from a text file, sorts them alphabetically by last name, and then by given names. The sorted names are then saved to a new text file.

Note: This application includes minmal tests, as it is not a part I have good expierence in developing.

Run via : .\name-sorter.exe ./unsorted-names-list.txt in \Application
